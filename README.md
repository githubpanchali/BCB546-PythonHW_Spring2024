# BCB546-PythonHW_Spring2024
This repository features a Jupyter notebook designed for DNA sequence analysis using Python and the Biopython library. Key functionalities include:

Translation Function: A custom function that translates DNA sequences into amino acids using a chosen codon table.
Protein Analysis: Uses Biopython's tools to compute the molecular weight of proteins and analyze their properties.
GC Content Calculation: A function dedicated to determining the GC content in DNA sequences.
Data Integration and Visualization: Scripts to merge sequence data into pandas DataFrames, compute additional metrics such as molecular weight, and create visualizations using matplotlib.
